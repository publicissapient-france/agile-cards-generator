agile-cards-generator
=====================

Hey Ho.

This is some python scripting to generate agile cards (typically User Stories) with a very simple xslx input as a template and a xslx output. In the output, a new tab is created with cards that can be printed out.

Please look at the list of enhancements before saying anything about this code as I know there are a lot of ugly things in it :) => https://github.com/xebia-france/agile-cards-generator/issues?labels=enhancement&page=1&state=open

Starting with very little knowledge on how to craft Python code, so bear with me/us.
